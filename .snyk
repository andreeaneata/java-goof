      # This example searches for string constants and identifiers (function or
      variable names) in the code. This can be

      # used to find sensitive hardcoded data such as passwords. You can also
      use the following templates to search for

      # strings or identifiers individually, and integers and booleans can be
      looked up as well:

      #     StringLiteral<"password">   - only finds string literals with the
      given value

      #     Identifier<"password">      - only finds identifiers (functions and
      variable names) with the given value

      #     NumberLiteral<1234>         - finds numbers (e.g. a port number)

      #     BooleanLiteral<"true">      - finds boolean constants of value
      "true" (note that capitalization matters -

      #                                   Python takes an upper-case "True")

      # Regular expressions (in Google re2 syntax) can be used in place of
      strings as well. For example, the following

      # query will match all string constants containing a "password" substring:

      #     StringLiteral<~".*password.*">

      # A wildcard predicate can be used to find any string, not just strings
      matching a specified text:

      #     StringLiteral<PRED:Any>
